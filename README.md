# phpWebSite Projects

This is a collection of phpWebSite projects authored by me in the mid aughts. I
was a core developer for the project for a few years and made many friends and
really got involved in the free software world. This code here is for archival 
purposes and likely wouldn't work anymore anyway. My coding skills have come a 
long way since those days, but this is the beginning of a project to preserve 
some of the older project code I had 100k+ users for many years. Drupal 
eventually won the battle of the CMS systems. We were university backed, Drupal
was backed by the community. I'm super happy they were able to accomplish so much, 
but phpWebSite had a significant place in history! At one point this was the most 
popular CMS in the world. Alas, times change, the rest is history and died with 
SourceForge.
