INSTALL steps for phpwsContacts

IMPORTANT: phpwsContacts is a module for phpWebSite 0.9.3-2.  You HAVE to
install phpWebSite >= 0.9.3-2 first, phpwsContacts will not work with
earlier versions of phpWebSite.  If you try to install phpwsContacts prior to
upgrading phpWebSite, you risk losing your contact data.

If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first get the latest code here:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL.txt included
in the docs directory of that download.

Once this is done then you can start installing phpwsContacts:

1. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.  (There is also a
   .zip file for windows users.)

2. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf phpwscontacts-*.tar.gz

3. Move the tarball into your web servers document root and rename it
   to "phpwscontacts".

    Example: If you are installing phpwsContacts 0.8.0 and your
    Apache doc root is /home/httpd/htdocs, you could run
    
    mv phpwscontacts-0.8.0 /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/phpwscontacts

4. Go to your phpWS website and install phpwsContacts from Boost.

   You are golden.  phpwsContacts is now installed.  However you will
   need to create a menu from Menu Manager and then add the phpwsContacts
   links.  After creating the menu, edit the menu and click on the "Add
   Module Default" button.  Select a phpwsContacts item from the drop-down.
   Repeat this process for the others until you have the links you want.

   I did it this way to keep things more consistent with phpWebSite.

If you are having trouble with these procedures please file a Support
Request at our sourceforge.net project site:
