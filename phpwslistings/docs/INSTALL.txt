INSTALL steps for phpwsListings

IMPORTANT: phpwsListings is a module for phpWebSite 0.9.x.  You have to
install phpWebSite >= 0.9.1 first, phpwsListings will not work with
earlier versions of phpWebSite.  If you don't have phpWebSite installed,
first get the latest code here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the instructions found in the docs/INSTALL.txt in that download.

One this is done then you can start installing phpwsListings:

1. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.

2. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf phpwslistings-*.tar.gz

3. Move the directory to /your/install/path/mod/

    Example: If you are upgrading to phpwsListings 0.3.2 and your
    phpWebSite doc root is /var/www/localhost/htdocs, you would run
    
    mv phpwslistings /var/www/localhost/htdocs/mod/phpwslistings

4. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.  If you use mysql, mysqldump is recommended.

5. Go to your phpWS website and install/upgrade phpwsListings from Boost.

You are golden.

6. If you are installing a new install of phpwsListings 0.3.2 you must:
    
    a. Go to the Manage Agents screen and activate a user (probably
       yourself) as an active agent.

    b. Create at least one listing class via the Create Listing Class
       screen.
