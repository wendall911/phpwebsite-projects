<blockquote><p>phpwsListings uses an "agent" system to assign responsibility and credit for a listing.  These agents are really phpWebSite users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
<b><a name="create">Adding New Agents</a></b>&nbsp;<a href="#create">&raquo;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To create a user, you must go through the normal "Add User" steps in the "User Manager" module of phpWebSite.  For a normal agent, you do not need to assign any phpwsListings permissions in the User Manager screen.  A normal agent is able to edit his/her own information and add/edit his/her own listings.</p>

<p>In the current version phpwsListings, new users will, by default be INACTIVE agents.  These agents will edit their own listings and edit their information, however they are <font color="red"><b>NOT</b></font> able to add new listings.  However they and their listings will not be displayed to normal users visiting the web site.  Nor will they be able to see fields marked "Agent-Only".  To activate an agent, see the "Activating Agents" section of this document.</p>

<p>Note that the agent still needs his personal information updated.  This includes first and last name, telephone numbers, etc.  To do this, you must enter the "Edit Agent" zone...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
<b><a name="activate">Activating Agents</a></b>&nbsp;<a href="#activate">&raquo;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To activate an agent, a phpwsListings admin must go to the phpwsListings admin menu and select "Manage Agents".  The admin will then be presented with a list of all agents.  The admin should find the new agent, and click on the "Activate" button.  The agent will then be active and his/her listings will be available for public consumption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
<b><a name="edit">Editing Agents</a></b>&nbsp;<a href="#edit">&raquo;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To edit settings for existing agents, one must travel the the phpwsListings menu and click on the "Manage Agents" button.  If the user is not an admin, the button is labelled as "Edit Agent".</p>

<p>Then the user is presented with a screen to edit information such as name, numbers, homepage, a biographical blurb, and an image.  Image thumbnails are automagically generated but are not yet used.  Future plans for an agent listing screen will use these.  Note that the drop-down list for Agency will be empty if no agencies are added into the system yet.</p>
