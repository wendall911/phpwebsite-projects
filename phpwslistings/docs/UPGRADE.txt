Upgrade steps for phpwsListings

1. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.

2. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf phpwslistings-*.tar.gz

3. Move the directory to /your/install/path/mod/

    Example: If you are upgrading to phpwsListings 0.3.2 and your
    phpWebSite doc root is /var/www/localhost/htdocs, you would run
    
    mv phpwslistings /var/www/localhost/htdocs/mod/phpwslistings

    Note: Be sure to overwrite the old dirctory. Running the new version and the
    old version together may cause problems.

4. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.  If you use mysql, mysqldump is recommended.

5. Go to your phpWS website and upgrade phpwsListings from Boost in your control
   panel.

6. There is a new "Default" Listing Class setting for your Listing Classes. One 
   has been set to default for you.  You should go to the Manage Listing Classes
   screen and edit the name to whatever class best suits your listings.  Also 
   note that the "Use Mortgage Calculator" setting has been moved to the class 
   level, as has been the "Use Price" setting.

   DO NOT DELETE THE "Default" CLASS.  You cannot re-assign listings to
   other classes, deleting the default class will leave existing listings
   in limbo and only an manual sql call will repair it.
